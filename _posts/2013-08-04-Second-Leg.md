Was too tired to write this up last night. So I am writing it today (the 5th).

##St. Louis

We woke up at about 6am and had a nice complimentary breakfast of eggs, biscuits & gravy, oatmeal, and coffee. Then we packed up and set out for the arch.

The arch was impressive - I wanted to take the elevator to the top, but we would've waited an additional two hours for it. So instead we checked out the [Museum of Westward Expansion](http://www.nps.gov/jeff/planyourvisit/museum-of-westward-expansion.htm) below the arch. We took a few pictures from there - see the bear, buffalo, horse, and more [o my].

##Kansas City

We left St. Louis fairly early and had yet another long, boring drive right through lunchtime; **hungry**. We stopped in the [Westport](http://westportkcmo.com/) area of KC and had lunch at the [Beer Kitchen](http://beerkitchenkc.com/). The burgers there are awesome!

##Siox City

This is where things started to get flat, remarkably flat and straight. Compared to I-70, there is hardly anyone on I-29. Pair that with the flat-straightness of it and the drive was actually pretty nice.
