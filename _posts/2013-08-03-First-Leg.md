Late last night we arrived in Columbus, OH. Not much happened on the way there, and there wasn't much to see either (was dark!). We were exhausted and were okay with the shitnasty motel we passed out in.

This morning we left Columbus towards Indianapolis. On the way we found [Heart of Ohio](http://www.heartofohioantiques.biz/) which is a giant warehouse full of antiques! A few of the pictures were taken from there.

After a quick look around the place we realized we could have easily spent the entire day there; massive.

Next we had a long, boring, and kinda hot drive to Indianapolis. To be honest, I don't think either of us were expecting much from the place, so when we arrived we were surprised at how clean and pretty the city was. **Brick everywhere**. Like cool, old brick buildings? You'd love this place. We passed through one of the most beautiful neighborhoods I think I've ever seen. I wanted to tour each one, and I **SHOULD** have taken some pics. Then we had a quick stroll about [Broad Ripple Village](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broad_Ripple_Village,_Indianapolis).

Next stop, Saint Louis! Another long, hot, and boring drive. We decided to use some of my Hilton Honors points to get a very nice room for tonight. Oh yeah - **IT WAS FREE TOO BAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHA**

Tomorrow we will check out Saint Louis a bit. Come back!
