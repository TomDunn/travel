##Sioux City

Here we had a rainy, thundering start. Didn't delay us much though and we continued up I-29.

These are areas are quite remote - we drove for miles at a time without seeing much beyond rest areas and such. Luckily, it is quite scenic. Vast flatness broken up by the occasional set of rolling hills.

##Petrified Wood Museum

The fact that something like this is what caught our eye should be a testament to how long we were in the car. I am glad we stopped though as we took some neat photos there. The main attraction here were the "logs". At one time, they were actually trees, but at some point they sank and were buried. Then the wood was replaced with varios minerals.

They also had an assortment of fossils inside.

##The Badlands

These were kickass. Highlight of the day.

Before actually entering the park, we stopped at a fuel station just outside. It looked like an old west store front, but all the cowboys were replaced with leather-clad, harley ridin' bikers. The scene was even complete with Praire Dogs!

Next, we entered the park. The views were beyond incredible, pictures can't do the place justice. Neither can my words really. You could see for miles, if not hundreds. Check out the pans and videos below.

##Pans

Keep in mind that I did these with my phone camera.
