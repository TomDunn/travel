This repo contains the source files of the [TDXC travel blog][url].

## Mynt

The site is build using the static site generator [Mynt](https://github.com/Anomareh/mynt). You can read about it there.

## What's different here?

A little python script that integrates the blog with some pictures from Instagram. The script looks for images that have a specific tag and are submitted by specified people. All the images are then grouped by day and outputted into JSON formatted files. These JSON files can be easily read by JavaScript and turned into galleries via [Galleria](http://galleria.io/).
